# aws-sagemaker-mnist

This project is about using the AWS Sagemaker machine learning ecosystem to build and deploy a linear learner for the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset. The dataset consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits between 0 and 9. The resulting model is a binary classifier that predicts whether handwritten digits are 0s or not.
